# Predicting Housing Prices with Machine Learning models
For this project, my focus is on applying various machine learning models in the Scikit Learn library e.g. LinearRegression and LogisticRegression, as well as regularization models e.g. Ridge to predict housing prices in the US.

### Outline of the project
1. Perform EDA and data cleaning
2. Feature Selection
3. Modelling and Intepretation
